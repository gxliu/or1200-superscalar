# or1200-superscalar
The goal of this project is to make the existing or1200 core superscalar (2/3 complete)\n

Currently, the processor has the ability to fetch and decode two insns but is only executing them one at a time.\n
This is becasue the addition is being built starting at the beginning of the pipeline
